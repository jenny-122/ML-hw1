a. Use the given Python code to find different polynomial regression functions for degrees
M={1,3,5,10,15} for the training set dataset

b. Plot each function with the following code

c. Get coefficient of the models with this function

d. Calculate the cost for training dataset and also for the validation set with learned regression
models. Use the cost equation that we learned in the class
